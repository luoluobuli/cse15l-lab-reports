## Lab Report 3
### Part 1 - Bugs
The bug I chose is from the method reverseInPlace() in ArrayExamples.
```
public class ArrayExamples {
  static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code
   ```
   @Test
   public void testReverseInPlace() {
     int[] input1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
     ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
     assertArrayEquals(new int[]{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}, input1);
   }
   ```
2. An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code
   ```
   @Test
   public void testReverseInPlace() {
     int[] input2 = {1};
     ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input2);
     assertArrayEquals(new int[]{1}, inpu2);
   }
   ```
3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests
   ![Image](Screenshot.png)
4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it  
   Before:
   ```
   static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
     for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
       arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
     }
   }
   ```
   After:
   ```
   static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
     int[] temArray = new int[arr.length];
     for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
       temArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
     }
     for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
       arr[i] = temArray[i];
     }
   }
   ```
   Explanation:
   In reverseInPlace(), when we replace the data in index i with another that in another index, the original data is lost and we can not get any of the first half of original data in this way. To fix this, I created a new array to store everything in reversed order, and then copied everything from the new array to the original one. In this way, the data inside the array can be correctly reversed. 

### Part 2 - Researching Commands
**My choice:** grep  
**Source:** [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)  
**Note:** Some outputs are super long. For the sake of brevity and readability, I only keep the first and last several lines of them.  
**Use -h as the option:**  
It displays the block of all matched lines, but not the filenames. It is useful when I only want to get the sentences that contain the keyword, maybe for research purpose.
```

**Use -o as the option:**  
It prints only the matched parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line. It is useful to find the certain files with the same reason as -l I wrote above. I think the matched parts printed may increase the clarity when using grep with multiple keywords.
