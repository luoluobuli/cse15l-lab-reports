Student's post:
I'm writing the method removeLast in MyDeque class and it failed the test when I ran my bash script, with error message shown in my screenshot. I also provided the code and script I wrote below. How should I fix my code?


There's a class MyDeque and a method removeLast() in it. I have a tester class CustomTester and I call removeLast() in one of my tests. Now I want to usd jdb to check inside removeLast() to see what is happening step by step. What should I do?
